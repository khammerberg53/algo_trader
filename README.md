# algo_trader
Repository containing the code for my autonomous trading system 

The primary script used for the algo trader that generated data for the project is the algo.py file. 
I've also included the code for the modified algo trader used in the presentation and an LSTM neural network I developed for a different class.  

To use this algorithmic trader you need an account with Alpaca and an account with AWS to generate the EC2 instance that will host the bot.
